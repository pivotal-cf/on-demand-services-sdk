# Build Service Adapters for the Cloud Foundry On-Demand Service Broker (ODB) in Golang

---

This is an SDK for writing service adapters for [ODB](https://docs.pivotal.io/svc-sdk/odb) in Golang. It encapsulates the command line invocation handling, parameter parsing, response serialization and error handling so the adapter authors can focus on the service-specific logic in the adapter. This will speed up the time to meeting the service author deliverables outlined [here](https://docs.pivotal.io/svc-sdk/odb/creating.html).

Before creating a service adapter you will need to have [BOSH release](https://bosh.io/docs) for the service that you wish to deploy.

After creating the service adapter and service BOSH release, you will be able to [configure the ODB](https://docs.pivotal.io/svc-sdk/odb/operating.html) provision new dedicated service instances from Cloud Foundry!

## Usage 

Please use the SDK tag that matches the ODB release you are targeting.

For example if using ODB 0.15.1 release, use the [0.15.1 SDK tag](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/on-demand-services-sdk/tree/v0.15.1).
